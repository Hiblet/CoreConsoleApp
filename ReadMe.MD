# CoreConsoleApp

## Introduction

This project is a Windows Visual Studio 2017 project for Asp.Net Core.  It is a very simple console application for using as a start point for console apps or test-bed apps for new ideas.

The app uses Log4Net and Debug logging, and has Options set up too.  It is intended for my own convenience but you're welcome to use it if you want.
